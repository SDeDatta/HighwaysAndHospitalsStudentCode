I started by coding the "base case" we discussed in class where highways cost more than hospitals so you can just put a hospital in each city. I then considered a way of approaching the problem as building all possible highways and then building the least number of hospitals necessary. Then, I could consider the trade off when I add a hospital vs remove a certain number of highways to decide if I continue breaking highways to build hospitals. |

I began thinking of different ways I could find the number of clusters and realized I can use DFS similarly as we used BFS in Moksha Patam but just iterate the number of "clusters" each time a new DFS begins. |
| Sep 15  | 3:10pm-4:40pm | I began writing actual code for the program. I realized it would be much easier if I knew what cities connected with others in a simpler way that the cities 2D array. So I made my own 2D list that reveals what cities can be connected to a given city. I then started working my DFS with the blueprint of BFS from last project. I used iterative DFS because research told me recursive DFS could crash at a certain number of cities. I researched the blueprint for DFS normally and adjusted it to this program so that I can look for "neighbors" and when there are no more neighbors for a given city, add 1 to the cluster count and move on to the next group of cities. |
