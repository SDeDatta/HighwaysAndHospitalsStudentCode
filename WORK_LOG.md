| Sep 11  | 9:00pm-9:20pm | I began by thinking about some potential ways to approach this problem. I started by coding the "base case" we discussed in class where highways cost more than hospitals so you can just put a hospital in each city. I then considered a way of approaching the problem as building all possible highways and then building the least number of hospitals necessary. Then, I could consider the trade off when I add a hospital vs remove a certain number of highways to decide if I continue breaking highways to build hospitals. |
