| Sep 11  | 9:00pm-9:20pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I began by thinking about some potential ways to approach this problem. I started by coding the "base case" we discussed in class where highways cost more than hospitals so you can just put a hospital in each city. I then considered a way of approaching the problem as building all possible highways and then building the least number of hospitals necessary. Then, I could consider the trade off when I add a hospital vs remove a certain number of highways to decide if I continue breaking highways to build hospitals. |
| Sep 14  | 8:20pm-9:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I resumed my previous way of approaching the problem until I was unsure how I would know what the minimal number of hospitals is without knowing the different "clusters" of cities. I began thinking of different ways I could find the number of clusters and realized I can use DFS similarly as we used BFS in Moksha Patam but just iterate the number of "clusters" each time a new DFS begins. |
| Sep 15  | 3:10pm-4:40pm  |                                                                                                                                     I began writing actual code for the program. I realized it would be much easier if I knew what cities connected with others in a simpler way that the cities 2D array. So I made my own 2D list that reveals what cities can be connected to a given city. I then started working my DFS with the blueprint of BFS from last project. I used iterative DFS because research told me recursive DFS could crash at a certain number of cities. I researched the blueprint for DFS normally and adjusted it to this program so that I can look for "neighbors" and when there are no more neighbors for a given city, add 1 to the cluster count and move on to the next group of cities. |
| Sep 20  | 12:30pm-1:15pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I essentially restarted how I wanted to approach the problem besides the base case I identified. I looked at the slides from class to begin incorporating Union-Find into my code. I ran into an issue where I didn't know how to diagnose components of the array that were "empty." But, I decided to make every node it's own root before going into the union find so I could then check for the "father nodes" with no roots. |
| Sep 21  | 2:00pm-3:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I worked on calculating the total cost using the number of clusters. I finished that and read over the code I'd written previously for union-find and fixed some bugs. One of the bugs included setting an edge to another edge instead of editing the array that stores the roots. Then, I incorporated path compression into my code. It took me some time to understand the pseudocode but I realized if I just kept following up the tree, a given node's parent should be the node's parent's root. |
| Sep 21  | 8:45pm-10:15pm | I tried to incorporate weight balancing into the code but really struggled for a while in distinguishing weights and roots. I was consistently getting index out of bounds errors that indicated a lack of distinction between the two. I figured it may be easier to understand what's going wrong if I abstract the code into different pieces. One piece was the part where I find the original root and path compress the chain while the other was where I attached made one node the other's root and used weight balancing. I finished dividing the code yet I still had issues and realized having arr{a] and a so much in my code with such similar names really threw me off. So, I distinguished the names of the two and adjusted what was equal to what in my union function to pass the three smaller tests. |

I essentially changed almost all my variables to long's and fixed the issue. I then began documenting. |
